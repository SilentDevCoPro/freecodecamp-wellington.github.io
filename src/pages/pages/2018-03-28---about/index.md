Welcome to the freeCodeCamp Wellington Meetup group. It's a study group for all levels of coders and totally free.

freeCodeCamp is a non-profit organisation teaching anyone to code. Learn with the full stack curriculum, available entirely online: http://www.freecodecamp.com/

This is a group for all Campers who want to get together and code collaboratively. We will set regular Meetups but feel free to plan your own and get together! This is a very open group dedicated to helping everyone learn together.

If you haven't already signed up for freeCodeCamp please sign up and completed the "Getting Started" section, and we can give you a helping hand from there if required.

Let's get together and learn, share, pair-program, and socialise!
